I use [Wunderlist](http://www.wunderlist.com) for organizing my todo-lists. The todo-list that has seen the most activity in the last year is called *Future Blog Posts*. 

Talk about procrastination.

As it always happens, [quantifying your own behavior](http://quantifiedself.com) leads to interesting insights. It quickly became apparent that the most reasonable way to contain such an unsustainable growth was to start consuming from that list. 

Hence blogging.

> Getting out of the door is the hardest part

When I start something, I usually spend an insane amount of time researching on all the possibilities. Then I move on to something else. I good way to counter this is to make-first, think later. In my books this means blog like you code, using your favorite revision control system and editor.

## Blogging Like a Hacker

[Github](http://github.com) Tom Preston-Werner's [Blogging Like a Hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) says it all. Blog like you code. Prototype fast, see changes live, no meta-meta-meta styles. 

Nowadays that concept has taken full shape in the [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). A free hosting of personal pages for *Jekyll*. The number of people who are hosting their personal pages on github is quickly increasing:

Reproducibility, open source is more the issue. You like me? Fork me on Github.

## Beauty Matters

As soon as I set on *Jekyll* ADD kicks in. Responsive, typography-oriented, mobile first, beautiful. I spend some time tinkering with the idea of making something like [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)'s page.

Then I wake up. I enjoy great design but I'm not a designer, much like I love food but not a chef. So I must follow recipes, perhaps slightly twist them to meet my need. Cutting down on salt, add some vinegar, but don't wing amounts or cooking times, that's a recipe for disaster. So, templates.

I spend a few hours looking around *Jekyll* themes with non boring yet minimal typography, and that look good on mobile. 
I came across a few nice articles on the matter (with code), by Stammy, Nicolas Hery. 
I come across *Ghost* and *Vapor*. [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is the new kid on the block, the media waxed poetic about it. *Vapor* is a *Ghost* theme by [Seth Lilly](http://sethlilly.com/), designed for responsiveness and with an eye on typography. 

*Ghost* and *Vapor* look great. Except, they're not based on Jekyll, nor they can be hosted on *Github Pages*. Make first, think later: I ported *Vapor* to *Jekyll*.
Check it out [here](https://github.com/LucaFoschini/jekyll-vapor), and see it live [here](http://lucafoschini.github.io/jekyll-vapor/).

## Data. Data. Data.

Data Driven Journalist is officially a thing.

Moreover, I personally have a hard time reading articles where claims are not supported by data (read: visualization). It's just a matter of bandwidth. 

That means, there must be nice charts and notebooks floating around.
*Jekyll* is a winner, as it allows including gists, external source, simplicity of including simple html and tweak it.

## Wrap up

Desiderata

 * Open Source
 * Beautiful
 * Mobile First
 * Data Oriented
