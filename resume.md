I'm Ph.D. graduate in **computer science**, specialized in algorithms for processing and analyzing large datasets. 

I was trained in **Computer Engineering** (BE/ME, University of Pisa) and **Computer Science** (MS/PhD, UCSB).

I'm passionate about the application of technology and data analysis to all aspects of life. In particular, I enjoy working to introduce the computing element in the loop of healthcare, food industry, and home automation.

# Skills

## Algorithms

I enjoy developing efficient algorithms for solving fundamental problems on complex input domains, such as **high-dimensional geometric data**, **time series**, and **networks**.

Specifically, my specialty is **approximation algorithms**, algorithms that attain a solution whose deviation from optimality can be **formally bounded**.

My academic research is highly interdisciplinar and touched upon a variety of subjects, including **computer security**, **data compression**, **computer vision**, **traffic engineering**, **networking**, and **computational geometry**. I'm specifically keen to working with domain experts and specialize general algorithmic techniques to solve problems specific to their domain. 

## Code

My go-to choices for programming languages are **Python** (more recently, **Julia**), **Ruby**, and **C++**. 

I've written code in a variety of other languages including Java, Objective C, Javascript, Perl, Bash, PHP, Pascal, Basic, Prolog, Lisp, x86 Assembly. 

I have extensive experience in system and **network programming** (Unix), app development (**Android/iOS**), and database query languages: **(No)SQL**. In a previous life, I have hacked kernel modules, written driver code, programmed microcontrollers and patched binaries. 

## Data

My daily tools are **R**, **Python** and **Tableau**. I scale things up using **Pig** on **Hadoop**. 

Data visualization plays a big part of my job, for which I use mostly **d3.js** (and derived libraries) 

## Tools

I put my code on **Github**, deploy webapps on **Heroku** (or locally on **Ruby on Rails**), and stay organized with **Trello** and **Wrike**. I general write all my code in Emacs but switch to **Xcode** or **Eclipse** for mobile apps or **RStudio** for R. I write publication-quality documents in **LaTeX** and **Inkscape**.

# Professional Experience

## The Activity Exchange, Inc. - Sep. 2012 / -
### Founder (Data Science)

At the Activity Exchange, I had a major role in developing AchieveMint, a reward platform for healthy activities. My notable contributions are: 

- **Mobile SDKs**. Initially, I led the **mobile effort** developing the SDKs (both Android and iOS) that enable health/wellness mobile apps to integrate with AchieveMint. Integrated apps enable their users to track their activities on the AchieveMint dashboard. AchieveMint's SDKs have been integrated in numerous apps, including apps with million users such as: **C25K**, **MonitorMyWeight**, **WeightSnap**. Assisting the app developers in the integration process has been a major part of my job. 

- **Data API**. I developed the first version of **AchieveMint API** based on Ruby on Rails. The API aggregates data coming from the mobile SDKs installed on the user devices and from other web-services connected to AchieveMint, such as: **FitBit**, **Jawbone**, **Withings**, etc.

- **Data Reporting**. I've used R and Tableau to explore the users data to discover correlations in the behavior of AchieveMint. In particular, I focused on aggregating information across different apps, and external sources (weather, census, etc.) and producing reports and business intelligence.  

## Google Research - Jun. 2011 / Sep. 2011
### Visiting Researcher

Notable contributions:

* I designed and adapted algorithms to detect set of highly connected nodes (communities) in large graphs.
* I implemented known algorithms and new variations on Google's **Mapreduce** and **Pregel** frameworks, allowing for processing graphs up to 150M nodes, 1B edges on thousand machines in few hours.

The position ended with a full time offer.

## Ask.com - Aug. 2005 / Apr. 2009
### Senior Sw. Eng - Oct. 2007 / Apr. 2009
### R & D - Aug. 2005 / Sep. 2007

Projects:

- **BigNews** - I developed a news aggregator engine to cluster news articles with similar topics. The system was capable of processing in real time a number of articles exceeding 150,000 a day, continuously downloaded from 5,000 feeds.

- **HotScore** - Designed and implemented an algorithm to rank news clusters based on many indicators, including freshness of the news, impact, and social recognition.

## CERN (European Center for Nuclear Research) Jun. 2004 / Sep. 2004
### System Administrator

I worked on improving the responsiveness of the administrative authentication system. That required developing custom features over the **Apache HTTP Server** authentication module.

## AICA (Italian Association for Computer Science) Jun. 2004 / Sep. 2004

I worked as coach of the Italian team designated to participate in the **International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)**, an international computer programming contest for high school students.
