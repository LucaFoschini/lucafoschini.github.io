##Professional

I'm a co-founder and resident data scientist at [The Activity
Exchange](http://www.theactivityexchange.com/). We founded the *The
Activity Exchange* because we believe that behavioral science can
provide insights to improve quality of living. 

In the past, I worked on news article aggregation at
[Ask.com](http://www.ask.com), on community detection in social
networks at [Google](www.google.com) and on low-latency web caching at
the [CERN](http://www.cern.ch).

##Research

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UCSB, under the guidance
of Professor [Subhash Suri](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~suri).

My researched focuses on developing efficient algorithms for computing
fundamental statistics on large streams of data. 
The proposed schemes come with sound theoretical foundations and are
simple enough to perform tasks such as outlier detection in real-time
on high-speed networks.

During my Ph.D. and visiting researching at [Google
Research](research.google.com), [ETH Zurich](http://www.ethz.ch/), and
[UIUC](http://illinois.edu) I've enjoyed collaborating with
scholars from many different fields of study. These includes *graph
partitioning*, *vehicle routing*, *computer security*, *data
compression*, and *computer vision*. 

See an updated list of my publications [here](publications.html).

##Personal

I live in Santa Barbara, CA, where I spend most of my spare time at a
small or negative distance from the Pacific Ocean. 

I grew up on [Cappelletti](http://www.ciaoitalia.com/seasons/season-2200/episode-2226/cappeletti-in-broth) and [Piadina](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piadina) on a farm near Ravenna, Italy.
