##Professional

I'm a Co-founder and resident data scientist at [The Activity
Exchange](http://www.theactivityexchange.com/). We founded the *The
Activity Exchange* because we believe that behavioral science can
provide insights to a better health and quality of living. 

In the past, I worked 5 years on news article aggregation at
[Ask.com](http://www.ask.com), on community detection in social
networks at [Google](www.google.com) and on low-latency web caching at
the [CERN](http://www.cern.ch).

##Research

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UCSB, under the guidance
of Professor [Subhash Suri](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~suri).

My researched focused on efficient algorithms for computing
fundamental statistics on large streams of data. 
The proposed schemes come with sound theoretical foundation and are
simple enough to perform real time outlier detection in real-world
high-speed networks.

During my Ph.D. and visiting researching at [Google
Research](research.google.com), [ETH Zurich](http://www.ethz.ch/), and
[UIUC](http://illinois.edu) I've enjoyed collaborating with
scholars from many different fields. These includes Graph
Partitioning, Vehicle Routing, Computer Security, Data Compression, Fuzzy
Logic, and Computer Vision. 

See an updated list of my publications [here](here).
