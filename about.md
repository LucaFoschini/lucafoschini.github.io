##Professional

I'm a co-founder and Head of Data Science at [Evidation Health](http://www.evidation.com/). 

In the past, I worked on aggregation of news articles at
[Ask.com](http://www.ask.com), on community detection in social
networks at [Google](www.google.com) and on low-latency web caching at
the [CERN](http://www.cern.ch).

##Research

My research focuses on designing efficient algorithms for finding
**approximate solutions** to problems for which computing an exact solution
would require an impractical amount of resources. 

Simply put, a recurrent pattern you'd find in my research papers
is *"This theorem proves that this problems can't be solved
exactly on large inputs within a reasonable amount of time or memory,
but if you're willing to settle for a slightly suboptimal solution, here's
an algorithm that can compute that efficiently."*

The problems I studied include [detecting
outliers](/papers/Efficiently_NSDI11.pdf) on large streams of network packets in real time; quickly [finding shortest paths](/papers/Complexity_Algorithmica.pdf) in
road networks under heavy traffic conditions; and efficiently [partitioning
large graphs](/papers/Balanced_Algorithmica.pdf) into balanced components. 


During my Ph.D. I was lucky enough to spend time visiting prestigious
research institutions such as [Google Research](research.google.com),
[ETH Zurich](http://www.ethz.ch/), and [UIUC](http://illinois.edu). 
That allowed me to collaborate with scholars from many different
fields of study, including [computational
geometry](/papers/Union_ESA11.pdf), [computer security](/papers/Getting_WOOT11.pdf), [data compression](/papers/Indexing_TOA.pdf), and [computer vision](/papers/Efficiently_ICIP11.pdf). 

You can find a complete list of my publications [here](publications.html).

##Personal

I live in Santa Barbara, CA, where I spend most of my spare time at a
small or negative distance from the Pacific Ocean.

I grew up on
[Cappelletti](http://www.ciaoitalia.com/seasons/season-2200/episode-2226/cappeletti-in-broth)
and [Piadina](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piadina) on a farm near Ravenna,
Italy.
